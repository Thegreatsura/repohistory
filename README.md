GitHub's 14-day limit on repository data often leaves developers without vital long-term insights. Repohistory addresses this by offering an easy-to-setup, beautifully designed interface for extended repository tracking. This gives developers a powerful tool to analyze trends and progress over time, not just a brief snapshot.
