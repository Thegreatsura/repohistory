## Motivation

GitHub limits access to only the past 14 days of your repoâ€™s traffic data, making it hard to track long-term trends. Repohistory solves this by helping you save traffic data every day, starting from first sign-in. You can then explore full traffic history in a beautifully designed dashboard, allowing you to analyze trends and get insights over time.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Extended Data Tracking**: Track repo clones, views, referrers and popular pages data for more than 14 days.
- âœ¨ **Beautiful Visualization**: View your repoâ€™s trends with clear, attractive charts.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Stars History**: Watch your repoâ€™s star growth over time with customizable chart.
